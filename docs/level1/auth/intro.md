# Authentication and Authorization

## Introduction

In this section, we'll explore two crucial concepts in application security: Authentication and Authorization. These concepts are fundamental to ensuring that our application can identify users and control access to resources.

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It answers the question, "Who are you?" In our todo application, we'll implement authentication using Firebase Authentication, allowing visitors to sign in anonymously as guest users. This will provide each user with a unique identifier, even if they haven't created a full account.

Key points:

- Firebase Authentication will be used to create guest user sessions
- Each user will receive a unique user ID
- This ID will be associated with their todos

Future sections will cover the more robust interaction of account creation using email address, password, etc.

But for now, the key benefit is our visitors will get unique user IDs we can use to save with their todos. This will allow our users to see only the todos they create.

## Authorization

Authorization follows authentication and determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do or access. It answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?" In our application, we'll implement authorization by modifying our business logic to ensure users can only access and modify their own todos.

Key points:

- The REST API will be updated to include user ID checks
- Requests for todos that don't belong to the current user will be rejected
- This ensures data privacy and separation between users

## Why It Matters

Implementing proper authentication and authorization is crucial for:

1. Protecting user data
2. Preventing unauthorized access
3. Ensuring each user has a personalized experience
4. Building trust with your users

By adding these features to our todo application, we're taking a significant step towards creating a more secure and user-centric web application.

## What We'll Do

In this section, we will:

1. Integrate Firebase Authentication into our application
2. Modify our database schema to include user IDs with todos
3. Update our business logic and REST API to enforce user-specific data access
4. Test our new authentication and authorization system

Let's get started!
