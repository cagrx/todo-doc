# Get User ID within API

In order to use the User ID throughout our backend, we need to first get it from the frontend.

## Add a Ping Endpoint

Before we do that, let's add a new `ping` endpoint to our API that serves two purposes:

1. It provides a lightweight endpoint that can be called to verify our service is up and running.
2. We can use it for learning how the authorization headers work.

### Add ping to the API

In `server.js` add the following code:

```javascript
app.get("/api/ping", async (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: "UP",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
});
```

Let's break down what this code does:

1. `app.get("/api/ping", ...)`:
   - This sets up a route that responds to GET requests at the `/api/ping`URL path.
2. `async (req, res) => { ... }`:
   - This is an async handler function for the route. It takes two parameters:
     - `req`: the incoming request object
     - `res`: the response object used to send back the response
3. `res.status(200)`:
   - Sets the HTTP status code of the response to 200 (OK), indicating a successful request.
4. `.json({ ... })`:
   - Sends a JSON response to the client. The `json()` method automatically sets the appropriate Content-Type header.
5. Inside the JSON object:
   - `status: "UP"`: Indicates that the service is running and available.
   - `timestamp: new Date().toISOString()`: Includes the current date and time in ISO 8601 format.

When a client makes a GET request to `/api/ping`, they will receive a 200 OK response with a JSON body like:

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "timestamp": "2023-06-07T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

This endpoint allows clients to quickly check if the server is responsive and get a timestamp of when the request was processed. It's a lightweight way to monitor the availability of your API service.

> You can test out this endpoint right away if you have Postman, Bruno, or other API testing tool.

### Add a ping button to the web page

Next let's add a button to our web page so we can call `ping`. For brevity, the button will be simple and unstyled, but we'll comment it out before we deploy it live.

Add the following HTML line immediately after the `<body>` tag in your web page.

```html
<div><button type="button" id="btn-ping">Ping</button></div>
```

Add the following javascript toward the top of `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {` preferably immediately after this line `const completedTodoList = ...`

```javascript
// Ping
const pingBtn = document.getElementById("btn-ping");

pingBtn.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("/api/ping");
    console.log(response);

    const responseData = await response.json();
    console.log(responseData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error pinging:", error);
  }
});
```

### Call the Ping API and View Results

Next:

1. Start your server: `node server.js`
2. Open your browser
3. Open a javascript console window
4. Visit your web page and click the "Ping" button.

You should see two outputs to the console:

    The results of `response` look like this:
    ```json
    Response {type: "basic", url: "http://localhost:3004/api/ping", redirected: false, status: 200, ok: true, â€¦}
    ```

    Whereas the results of `responseData` look like this:
    ```json
    {status: "UP", timestamp: "2025-01-15T01:34:29.638Z"}
    ```

Here's the difference between the two:

1. `response`:

   - This is the raw Response object returned by the `fetch()`function.
   - It contains information about the HTTP response, such as status code, headers, and the response body.
   - At this stage, the response body hasn't been parsed yet.
   - When you log `response`, you'll see the Response object with its properties and methods.
   - Here are some of the properties of `response`:
     1. Status Code: `response.status` (e.g., 200, 404, 500)
     2. Status Text: `response.statusText` (e.g., "OK", "Not Found")
     3. Headers: `response.headers` (a Headers object containing response headers)
     4. URL: `response.url` (the final URL of the response)
     5. Type: `response.type` (e.g., "basic", "cors")
     6. OK status: `response.ok` (boolean indicating if the status is in the 200-299 range)
   - In the future we'll be evaluating `response.ok` to see if we need to alert the user to issues.
   - For a comprehensive list of standard response codes, [see: HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

2. `responseData` from `response.json()`:
   - `response.json()` is a method called on the Response object to parse the response body as JSON.
   - It returns a Promise that resolves to the parsed JSON data.
   - When you log `responseData` (which is the result of `await response.json()`), you'll see the actual data contained in the response body, parsed as a JavaScript object or array.
   - In our example, the json data we returned in `ping`'s response:
   1. `responseData.status` ("UP")
   2. `responseData.timestamp` (2025-01-15T01:34:29.638Z)

### Now Let's Include the Token in the API Call

Update your client-side javascript to send the token in the header:

```javascript
// Ping
const pingBtn = document.getElementById("btn-ping");

pingBtn.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  try {
    // Get the user token
    const token = await getIdToken();
    const response = await fetch("/api/ping", {
      headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer " + token,
      },
    });
    console.log(response);

    responseData = await response.json();
    console.log(responseData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error pinging:", error);
  }
});
```

Here's a brief explanation of the code we just added:

1. headers:
   - In HTTP requests, headers are additional pieces of information sent with the request.
   - They provide context and metadata about the request, such as the type of content being sent, authentication information, etc.
2. Authorization:
   - This is a standard HTTP header used for sending authentication credentials to the server.
   - It tells the server how to authenticate the client making the request.
3. Bearer:
   - This is an authentication scheme used with the Authorization header.
   - "Bearer" indicates that the client should get access to the resource because they possess a certain token (usually a JWT - JSON Web Token).
   - The format is typically: "Bearer "
4. token:
   - This is the actual authentication token obtained from a previous login or authentication process (Firebase Auth via anonymous signing in our example).
   - In this code, it's retrieved by calling `getIdToken()`.
   - Tokens are used to authenticate the user without sending username and password with every request.

Putting it all together:

```javascript
headers: {
  Authorization: "Bearer " + token,
}
```

This code is adding an Authorization header to the fetch request. It's telling the server, "Here's a token that proves who I am and that I have the right to access this resource." You will later write server code that will then validate this token to ensure the request is coming from an authenticated and authorized user.

This pattern is common in modern web applications, especially those using JWT for authentication. It allows the server to maintain stateless authentication, improving scalability and security.

### Call the Ping API and View Results

Next:

1. Start your server: `node server.js`
2. Open your browser
3. Open a javascript console window
4. Visit your web page and click the "Ping" button.
5. View your server's terminal for any output

**There is no output**

Why? Because we haven't asked our endpoint to log any.

Add the following `console.log` line of code to `ping`:

```javascript
app.get("/api/ping", async (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.headers);

  res.status(200).json({
    status: "UP",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
});
```

### Call the Ping API and View Results

Next:

1. (Re)start your server: `node server.js`
2. Open your browser
3. Open a javascript console window
4. Visit your web page and click the "Ping" button.
5. View your server's terminal for any output

You should see something like this:

```json
{
  "host": "localhost:3004",
  "accept": "*/*",
  "sec-fetch-site": "same-origin",
  "sec-fetch-mode": "cors",
  "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/18.3 Safari/605.1.15",
  "authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjQwZDg4ZGQ1NWQxYjAwZDg0ZWU4MWQwYjk2M2RlNGNkOGM0ZmFjM2UiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJwcm92aWRlcl9pZCI6ImFub255bW91cyIsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc2VjdXJldG9rZW4uZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS90b2RvLWFwcC1kZmY1MSIsImF1ZCI6InRvZG8tYXBwLWRmZjUxIiwiYXV0aF90aW1lIjoxNzM2OTA0NDA2LCJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiUXBUbHVnekRGUGZxMTUybkdHYWVxRk9Vd1RKMyIsInN1YiI6IlFwVGx1Z3pERlBmcTE1Mm5HR2FlcUZPVXdUSjMiLCJpYXQiOjE3MzY5MDQ0MDYsImV4cCI6MTczNjkwODAwNiwiZmlyZWJhc2UiOnsiaWRlbnRpdGllcyI6e30sInNpZ25faW5fcHJvdmlkZXIiOiJhbm9ueW1vdXMifX0.n_awVqnil8aO9MQHji90nIqB-DGTScJR5vCfeGANZCbi5mwFs2jsFIEfPcFz9EOcGyupmn-lRrGqp02-hEouMNY75GJHQ5ZV_3qKPp4Vu5xl8vXd5ny_qkbX80IE57nj-2WKx8PqOQyHC10DWQZrIetK6vaRBe4DV2f2iiQ-uJULGfgm2Y9GhnD7TuARWtJMLStGE9oiAjinFAMlnJwYer-3S7UlhdMdM_56SFNpwP47TqbcIFncYBg-Nw0SHK2lbiOOzrsbmKopTS25m8I9axkro8HqOlVKatbHFqPqxfQws0rb57aIWNGsCOZa2LYh0dBMNvmNWzHlX1kyw_ygSg",

  "accept-language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
  "priority": "u=3, i",
  "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate",
  "connection": "keep-alive"
}
```

In the prior example, we were looking a **response** values in the browser's javascript console.

In this example, we are looking at **request** values in the server's console output.

The key item we're looking at here is the `authorization` header. That contains our token which we can use to get the User ID.

Modify our `ping` endpoint to extract the User ID from the token:

```javascript
app.get("/api/ping", async (req, res) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  if (!authHeader || !authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
    throw new Error("Missing or invalid token");
  }

  const idToken = authHeader.split("Bearer ")[1];
  try {
    const decodedToken = await admin.auth().verifyIdToken(idToken);
    const user_id = decodedToken.uid;
    console.log(user_id);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error("Invalid token");
  }

  res.status(200).json({
    status: "UP",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
});
```

Note: This code is not robust, but is for temporary demonstration purposes only.

Next:

1. (Re)start your server: `node server.js`
2. Open your browser
3. Open a javascript console window
4. Visit your web page and click the "Ping" button.
5. View your server's terminal for any output

You should see something like this: `Sl8n6LJ86vQGSkwlsvGdqcLijxX2`
This is the User ID included in the token, and should match the User ID that is output to the web browser console (from Firebase Auth Part 1).

These new lines of code:

1. Extract the token from the Authorization header in the incoming request.
2. Verify that the Authorization header exists and follows the `Bearer <token>` format.
3. Use the Firebase Admin SDK to verify and decode the token.
4. Log the decoded userâ€™s UID, confirming successful token verification.

Specifically:

1. **Extract Authorization Header**:

   ```javascript
   const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
   ```

   - Retrieves the `Authorization` header from the request.

2. **Validate the Authorization Header**:

   ```javascript
   if (!authHeader || !authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
     throw new Error("Missing or invalid token");
   }
   ```

   - Ensures the `Authorization` header is present and starts with `"Bearer "`.
   - If the header is missing or does not follow the expected format, an error is thrown with the message `"Missing or invalid token"`.

3. **Extract the Token**:

   ```javascript
   const idToken = authHeader.split("Bearer ")[1];
   ```

   - Extracts the token portion by splitting the header string after `"Bearer "`.
   - The resulting `idToken` contains the actual token used for authentication.

4. **Verify and Decode the Token**:

   ```javascript
   const decodedToken = await admin.auth().verifyIdToken(idToken);
   ```

   - Uses Firebase Admin SDK's `verifyIdToken` method to verify the token.
   - If the token is valid, it decodes the token payload into `decodedToken`.
   - This step ensures the token is authentic and provides additional information (e.g., user ID).

5. **Log the User's UID**:

   ```javascript
   const user_id = decodedToken.uid;
   console.log(user_id);
   ```

   - Extracts the user ID (`uid`) from the decoded token and logs it to the console.
   - This demonstrates successful verification and confirms the user's identity.

6. **Handle Verification Errors**:

   ```javascript
   } catch (error) {
       throw new Error("Invalid token");
   }
   ```

   - If the token verification fails (e.g., due to an expired or tampered token), an error is thrown with the message `"Invalid token"`.

7. **Send Success Response**:
   ```javascript
   res.status(200).json({
     status: "UP",
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
   });
   ```
   - Sends an HTTP 200 OK response containing:
     - `"status": "UP"`: Indicates the service is operational.
     - `"timestamp"`: The current timestamp in ISO 8601 format, providing a time reference for the response.

### Error Handling

Errors are thrown in two cases:

- Missing or invalid `Authorization` header: `"Missing or invalid token"`.
- Invalid or unverified token: `"Invalid token"`.

### Full decodedToken Contents

Is our example, we got the decodedToken and and accessed its uid property:

```javascript
const decodedToken = await admin.auth().verifyIdToken(idToken);
const user_id = decodedToken.uid;
console.log(user_id);
```

But what else is available from the `decodedToken`? Add this line to find out:

```javascript
const decodedToken = await admin.auth().verifyIdToken(idToken);
const user_id = decodedToken.uid;
console.log(user_id);
console.log(decodedToken);
```

Restart your server and ping from the browser. You should see in the server console something that looks like:

```json
{
  "provider_id": "anonymous",
  "iss": "https://securetoken.google.com/todo-app-dff51",
  "aud": "todo-app-dff51",
  "auth_time": 1736786430,
  "user_id": "Sl8n6LJ86vQGSkwlsvGdqcLijxX2",
  "sub": "Sl8n6LJ86vQGSkwlsvGdqcLijxX2",
  "iat": 1737049158,
  "exp": 1737052758,
  "firebase": { "identities": {}, "sign_in_provider": "anonymous" },
  "uid": "Sl8n6LJ86vQGSkwlsvGdqcLijxX2"
}
```

This is the current decoded Firebase ID token contents. Remember that our user is anonymous - they haven't provided any information like usernames or email addresses.

A fuller representation of a non-anonymous user might look like this:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://securetoken.google.com/<project-id>", // Issuer of the token
  "aud": "<project-id>", // Audience (Firebase project ID)
  "auth_time": 1619876543, // Time of authentication (Unix timestamp)
  "user_id": "1234567890", // Firebase UID of the user
  "sub": "1234567890", // Subject (same as user_id)
  "iat": 1619876543, // Issued at time (Unix timestamp)
  "exp": 1619877143, // Expiration time (Unix timestamp)
  "email": "user@example.com", // User's email address (if available)
  "email_verified": true, // Whether the email is verified
  "name": "John Doe", // User's display name (if available)
  "picture": "https://example.com/photo.jpg", // User's profile picture URL (if available)
  "firebase": {
    "identities": {
      "email": ["user@example.com"], // Linked email addresses
      "google.com": ["123456789012345678901"] // Linked provider IDs (e.g., Google)
    },
    "sign_in_provider": "google.com" // Sign-in provider (e.g., password, Google)
  },
  "custom_claims": {
    // Custom claims added in Firebase (if any)
    "admin": true
  }
}
```

For now we'll stick with our anonymous user.

## What's Next

In this section, we explored how to retrieve the user ID from a Firebase token within a single route.

While effective, handling token validation directly in each route can lead to duplication and reduced maintainability.

In the next section, weâ€™ll refactor the token-handling logic into a reusable verifyToken middleware function, demonstrating how middleware enables cleaner, more modular, and scalable API design.

<!--

### Formalizing The Code


We're going to be extracting the User ID from the token a lot moving forward. So let's move the code into its own function within `server.js`.

Add this function near the top of the file:

```javascript
// Get the user id from Firebase
// If we can't get a valid id, then throw an error
async function getFirebaseUserId(authorizationHeader) {
  const idToken = authorizationHeader?.split("Bearer ")[1];
  if (!idToken) {
    throw new Error("No token provided");
  }

  try {
    const decodedToken = await admin.auth().verifyIdToken(idToken);
    return decodedToken.uid;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error("Invalid token");
  }
}
```

Then let's change `ping` to use it:

```javascript
app.get("/api/ping", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    console.log(req.headers.authorization);
    const user_id = await getFirebaseUserId(req.headers.authorization);
    console.log(user_id);
    res.status(200).json({
      status: "UP",
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

We've changed `ping` to catch an error and return HTTP response 500 "Internal Server Error" is something goes wrong.

Next:

1. (Re)start your server: `node server.js`
2. Open your browser
3. Open a javascript console window
4. Visit your web page and click the "Ping" button.
5. View your server's terminal for any output

You should see the User ID as a value like this: `Sl8n6LJ86vQGSkwlsvGdqcLijxX2`

### Using Postman

You can also call the API via Postman.

You'll need the authorization header (which `ping` logs to the console).
It should look like this:

```
Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjQwZDg4ZGQ1NWQxYjAwZDg0ZWU4MWQwYjk2M2RlNGNkOGM0ZmFjM2UiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJwcm92aWRlcl9pZCI6ImFub255bW91cyIsImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc2VjdXJldG9rZW4uZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS90b2RvLWFwcC1kZmY1MSIsImF1ZCI6InRvZG8tYXBwLWRmZjUxIiwiYXV0aF90aW1lIjoxNzM2OTA0NDA2LCJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiUXBUbHVnekRGUGZxMTUybkdHYWVxRk9Vd1RKMyIsInN1YiI6IlFwVGx1Z3pERlBmcTE1Mm5HR2FlcUZPVXdUSjMiLCJpYXQiOjE3MzY5MDg4NTAsImV4cCI6MTczNjkxMjQ1MCwiZmlyZWJhc2UiOnsiaWRlbnRpdGllcyI6e30sInNpZ25faW5fcHJvdmlkZXIiOiJhbm9ueW1vdXMifX0.iJ67Vm4if6OjaZS14iEtDMPegVQcaFDncNYBVpuyt5YqmZpHGmZR-In7uoWn9ET6buFmg6HcUMTo7wwt_4a5vCOedmTNQgOnebIdmLGqkj82wc27X-JqeBQ2PplxQxtkkvr_Yr0v1nhy1z_h5gZqoofsdzW13-cAAqI8sC8Dbw1bzd0xDctQK4w7JGw44-cMfYnBrY6SIJ9eRmvfu0wS5d4CW0ZlvOPfmj3uCWItpDxl_Cm32IrOV9QuJ208Sx5XpAm35ZUVofDKwIhBYtSbOX1nlaUZZ5C-ic5PjC0S6idaLP8jTKj8GBobl4q2Z0q96ox1DlUNQPXc2w0q_22Xgg
```

In Postman, configure a `GET` call for `http://localhost:3004/api/ping`

If you attempt the call without setting the authorization header, you should see a response code 500 (Internal Server Error) with the response data:

```json
{
  "error": "UnauthorizedError is not defined"
}
```

Go to Headers, and add a new Header:

- `Name`: Authorization
- `Value`: Paste the entire authorization header, including `Bearer `

Now try to call `ping` and you should see response code 200 (OK) and a response data like:

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T02:52:35.384Z"
}
```
-->
