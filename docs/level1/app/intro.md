# Building the Application Tier

## Introduction

With our database in place, we're now ready to build the application tierâ€”a crucial layer that sits between data storage and the user interface, containing our todo application's core business logic. In this lesson, we'll create and test the fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations that interact with our todo database.

By focusing on the application tier at this stage, we avoid the common pitfall of only testing business logic through the presentation layer. This approach ensures a clean separation of concerns and allows us to verify that our business components function correctly in isolation. Crucially, it prevents presentation logic, layout concerns, or platform-specific code from mixing into our business layer. This separation makes our application tier highly reusable across different platforms and interfaces, whether it's a web application, mobile app, or even a command-line interface.

Our goal is to build a robust foundation that's thoroughly tested before integrating with any user interface or API layer. This method promotes better code quality, easier maintenance, and more flexible integration options in the future. By keeping our business logic pure and separate, we ensure it remains versatile and can be easily adapted for various consumers without modification.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Implement CRUD operations for todo items
2. Write comprehensive tests for these operations
3. Understand the importance of separating business logic from data storage and presentation layers
4. Recognize how a well-structured application tier enhances reusability across different platforms

## Steps

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

- Ensure Node.js and npm are installed
- Initialize a new Node.js project if not already done
- Install necessary dependencies: `mysql2` for database interactions

### 2. Creating Database Connection (db.js)

- Set up a connection pool to the MySQL database
- Implement error handling for database connection issues

### 3. Implementing CRUD Operations (todoOperations.js)

- Create functions for each CRUD operation:
  - `createTodo`: Add a new todo item
  - `getAllTodos`: Retrieve all todo items
  - `updateTodo`: Modify an existing todo item
  - `deleteTodo`: Remove a todo item
- Implement proper error handling and input validation for each function

### 4. Writing Tests (testOperations.js)

- Create a test file to verify each CRUD operation
- Implement tests for:
  - Creating a todo with valid and invalid data
  - Retrieving all todos
  - Updating a todo with various scenarios (full update, partial update)
  - Deleting a todo
- Ensure tests cover both successful operations and error cases

### 5. Running and Verifying Tests

- Execute the test file and analyze the results
- Debug and fix any issues uncovered by the tests

## Key Concepts to Emphasize

- Separation of concerns: Keep database operations separate from business logic
- Error handling: Implement robust error handling in all functions
- Input validation: Validate all inputs before processing
- Testing in isolation: Test the business layer independently of the presentation layer

## Conclusion

By completing this lesson, you'll have a solid foundation for your todo application's backend. The CRUD operations and their corresponding tests ensure that your application's core functionality is reliable and well-structured. This approach sets the stage for easier integration with various front-end solutions and API implementations in the future.
