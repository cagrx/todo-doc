# Building a Full-Stack Todo Application: A Multi-Tier Architecture Project

Welcome to this hands-on project where you'll build a fully functional todo application from the ground up! This project is designed to give you practical experience in developing a modern, multi-tier web application using industry-standard technologies and best practices.

## Project Overview

In this course, you'll create a todo list application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. The application will feature a user-friendly interface, secure data storage, and robust backend processing. By the end of this project, you'll have a working application deployed to the cloud, accessible from anywhere.

## What You'll Learn

- **Multi-Tier Architecture**: Understand how to structure an application into frontend, backend, and database tiers.
- **Frontend Development**: Build an interactive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend Development**: Create a server-side application using Node.js and Express.js to handle business logic and API requests.
- **Database Management**: Set up and interact with a MySQL database using Amazon RDS.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy your application to Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Version Control**: Use Git and GitHub for code management and collaboration.
- **API Development**: Design and implement RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend.
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication to secure your application.

## Technologies You'll Use

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MySQL on Amazon RDS
- Cloud Platform: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Version Control: Git and GitHub
- Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, Navicat MySQL

## Project Structure

1. **Setup and Introduction**: Set up your development environment and AWS account.
2. **Database Design**: Create and configure your MySQL database on Amazon RDS.
3. **Backend Development**: Build the server-side application and APIs.
4. **Frontend Development**: Develop the user interface for the todo application.
5. **Integration**: Connect the frontend, backend, and database.
6. **Authentication**: Add user login and registration functionality.
7. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy your application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
8. **Testing and Refinement**: Test your application and make final adjustments.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this project, you'll have created a fully functional todo application where users can:

- Register and log in securely
- Add, view, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Filter and sort tasks

Your application will be cloud-hosted, scalable, and built using best practices in modern web development.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- A computer with internet access

No prior experience with backend development or cloud services is required, but a willingness to learn and experiment is essential!

Let's get started on this exciting journey of building a real-world, full-stack web application!
